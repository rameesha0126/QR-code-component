## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using HTML 5 landmarks: 
```html
<main class="background">
<img src="images\image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code image">
<h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
<p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to next level</p>
```

Using flexbox to center the QR component element 
```css
.background {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

Using HTML accessibility landmarks and using CSS to position HTML elements similar to designs provided with the least amount of code.

### Useful resources
